.TP
.B \-nosramsch

.TP
.B \-kontra
Allow opponents to say 'Kontra' which doubles the score of the game.
The Soloist may reply 'Re' to double the score again.
.TP
.B \-nokontra
Disallow Kontra (default).
.TP
.B \-kontra18
Only an opponent who said at least 18 may say 'Kontra'.
.TP
.B \-bock
Play a Bockround after some special event.
The score is doubled in the next 3 games.
If an event causing a new Bockround happens before the current Bockround
is over or several Bockround events happen at the same time,
the number of Bockrounds still to play is increased appropriately.
.TP
.B \-nobock
Don't play Bockrounds (default).
.TP
.B \-bockramsch
Play a round of compulsory Ramsch after each Bockround.
Before a game of Ramsch begins, each player in turn, starting with Forehand,
may declare to play Grand Hand instead.
After a Grand Hand the same player deals again
because this game does not count towards completing the Ramschround.
.TP
.BI \-bockevents " number"
Specify the events that cause a Bockround.
.nf
.ne 8
(1) A game is lost with 60 points.
(2) A successful Grand Hand.
(4) A successful Kontra (opponents win).
(8) A game with Kontra & Re.
(16) A player's score ends in 3 equal digits.
(32) A player's score is a multiple of 100.
(64) A game value of +72 or more.
(128) A game value of +96 or more.
.fi
Add up the numbers in parentheses to specify the
desired events (default: 0).
.br
Notes:
.br
A Kontra where the Soloist said Re but lost counts
as one event not two (events 4 and 8).
.br
To check a player's score, the current listing options of player1 are used
(events 16 and 32).
A score that is a multiple of 1000 counts as one event.
.br
The game value (events 64 and 128) is the normal value
without considering any doubling caused by Ramsch, Kontra or Bock.
.TP
.B \-resumebock
Resume unfinished Bockrounds after quitting and restarting
.BR XSkat .
The number of games to play is read from the game list file.
.TP
.B \-noresumebock
Don't resume Bockrounds (default).
.TP
.B \-spitze
Allow the Soloist to declare Spitze.
This means that the last trick must be made with the lowest trump
to win the game.
This will be indicated to the other players by displaying the lowest trump.
The game multiplier is increased by 1.
It's not allowed to say Spitze in a Grand with 4 jacks.
.TP
.B \-spitze2
Declaring Spitze increases the multiplier by 2.
.TP
.B \-nospitze
Don't allow Spitze (default).
.TP
.B \-revolution
Enable a special variation of Null ouvert.
After the Soloist's cards are exposed the opponents can look at
each other's cards and rearrange the cards between their two hands
in any way they wish before the start of the play.
Revolution is worth 92 points.
.TP
.B \-norevolution
Don't allow Revolution (default).
.TP
.B \-klopfen
During a Ramschround you may knock (klopfen) at the beginning of a game
to indicate that you think you won't lose.
This will double the score of the game.
Klopfen is not possible if you don't pick up the Skat
in Schieberamsch.
.TP
.B \-noklopfen
Don't allow Klopfen (default).
.TP
.B \-schenken
If the opponents decide at the start of the play that they cannot defeat
the Soloist, they can give up.
This is done by selecting Schenken from the main menu during the first trick
when it's your turn.
If the Soloist accepts, the score is as though the game was won simply.
The Soloist can insist on playing on, but in that case has to make
the opponents Schneider to win.
The score in this case is as for an announced Schneider
(the multiplier is increased by 2).
If the Soloist goes on the opponents can schenken again,
giving the Soloist the Schneider.
The Soloist can accept Schneider or insist on playing on for Schwarz.
.TP
.B \-noschenken
Don't allow Schenken (default).
.TP
.B \-hint
Put a mark over the card the computer would play.
.TP
.B \-nohint
Don't show computer hints (default).
.TP

.br
(default)
.TP
.B \-oldrules
Lost Hand games count simple.
.br
The Grand Ouvert multiplier is 36.
.TP
.B \-shortcut
Always finish the game when the remaining tricks will all go to one side.
.TP
.B \-noshortcut
Play each trick.
.TP
.B \-askshortcut
Ask whether a shortcut should be taken (default).
.TP
.B \-irc
Play via Internet Relay Chat.
This option will establish a connection to an IRC server
where you can join other people for a game of Skat.
.br
How it works:
.br
Start
.B XSkat
from an xterm. Wait until the server has printed the welcome message.
You are now on channel #xskat where new games should be planned.
Everything you type into the xterm will be sent to everyone else
on this channel. After you have found one or two other players
and agreed upon the name of a new channel (say #xskat123),
you should type
.BR /join " #xskat123."
When all players are on the new channel,
exactly one player has to type
.BR /go " (or " /go2
if there are only 2 players) to start the game. Now you can play and talk.
.TP
.B \-noirc
Don't use IRC (default).
.TP
.BI \-irctelnet " program"
Specify the program that will be used to connect to the IRC server.
If you are sitting behind a firewall, a program like rtelnet must be used
and you may have to set $SOCKS_SERVER to the name
of your firewall host (default: telnet).
.TP
.BI \-ircserver " host-name"
Select an IRC server near you! (default: $IRCSERVER
or irc.fu-berlin.de, if not changed in the Imakefile/Makefile)
.TP
.BI \-ircport " number"
The port of the IRC server to connect to (default: $IRCPORT or 6667).
.TP
.BI \-ircchannel " name"
The channel to join initially (default: #xskat).
.TP
.BI \-ircnick " name"
Your IRC nickname. If your nick is already used by someone else,
a different nick will be generated automatically.
Some servers allow a nick length of 30, others limit it to 9 characters.
(default: $IRCNICK or $IRCUSER or $LOGNAME or xskatNNNN).
.TP
.BI \-ircuser " name"
Your user/login name. Note: most servers don't like faked user names
(default: $IRCUSER or $LOGNAME).
.TP
.BI \-ircrealname " name"
Your real name (default: $IRCNAME or the entry from the passwd file
or 'XSkat player').
.TP
.BI \-ircpos " number"
Select your position relative to the other players. Positions are numbered
clockwise 1, 2 and 3. Player 2 will start dealing
if not specified otherwise with
.BR \-start " or " /start .
If you don't specify your position or there is a conflict with someone
else's choice or you give an invalid number (3 in a 2 player game),
this will be fixed automatically. Choosing the right positions is
important if you want to continue with a saved game list
(default: 0 = I don't care).
.TP
.BI \-irclog " file"
Everything sent to or received from the IRC server is saved to this file
(\- means stdout).
It may be useful for debugging
(default: $HOME/.xskat.ilg or ./xskat.ilg).
.TP
.B \-irclogappend
Append output to the log file.
.TP
.B \-irclogoverwrite
Overwrite existing log file (default).
.TP
.B IRC commands:
.br
.BR /nick " name, " /nick
\- change or display your nickname.
.br
.B /who
\- is on the current channel ?
.br
.B /list, /list string
\- show all channels that match the word xskat or the specified string.
This will take some time on networks with a large number of channels.
Trying to stop the listing will terminate the program.
.br
.BR /pos " number \- see " \-ircpos .
.br
.B /bell
\- toggle the alarm bell. When on, the bell will ring each time someone
joins your channel or sends a message to you.
The bell is off initially.
.br
.B /quit
\- terminate
.BR XSkat .
.br
.B /sync
\- if messages get lost due to a net-split (or because someone left the
channel during play),
.B XSkat
will detect this and in most cases should be able to synchronize
automatically (within 30 seconds) after the connection is reestablished.
Typing
.B /sync
will try this immediately.
.br
.BR /quote " command args"
\- for those who know what they are doing.
.br
The following commands are only useful for the player
who will start the game by typing
.B /go
because that player will determine the rules of the game.
.br
.B /default
\- set the official rules.
.br
.B /ramsch, /sramsch, /skattoloser, /kontra, /bock, /resumebock,
.B /spitze, /revolution, /klopfen, /schenken, /oldrules,
.B /bockevents, /alist, /tlist, /start, /s1
\- change the rules of the game.
All of these require an argument (a number or True/False) just like
the resources with the same name.
.br
.B /rules
\- show the current rules to everyone on your channel.
.TP
.B Notes:
The version numbers of all participating programs must be equal.
.br
Most options cannot be changed during the game.
Options that can be changed are not saved to a file.
.br
The game list can only be cleared during bidding or when it's your turn
to play a card.
There is a different default game list for IRC games (see
.BR \-list ).
.br
It's possible to type into the xterm or the game window
(which is recommended),
but changing input sources in the middle of a line won't work.
.br
If you want better input line editing and a split screen try the program ssfe.
It is used like this: ssfe \-raw xskat \-irc
.br
You can omit
.B \-irc
when you specify any of the other IRC options.
.TP
.BI \-auto " #ofgames"
Three computers play the specified number of games without human interaction.
The resulting scores are printed.
.br
With this option, no resources are read,
and the game list is saved only if
.B \-list
is specified.
.TP
.BI \-opt " filename"
The file for saving/restoring all interactively changeable options
of all players
(default: $HOME/.xskat.opt or ./xskat.opt).
Command line options take precedence over
options specified in this file which in turn override
resource specifications.
This may be changed with the
.B useoptfile
resource.
.TP
.IB player @ display
Specifies the display of the second and third player
(but is ignored for IRC games).
The
.IB player @
part may be omitted if the
.B alias
resource is set on
.IR display .

.B useoptfile
True or False (default: False).
This is a resource for multiplayer mode (but not for IRC).
It is ignored for player1.
If set to True, the contents of the option file,
which is owned by player1,
are used.
This means that you may end up with someone else's preferred settings
if player1 used this file in a different multiplayer game.
.TP
.B alias
The player's real name (max. 2 words of 9 characters, default: $LOGNAME).
.PP
Only player1 may specify the resources marked with (#).
.PP
Filenames starting with ~/ are interpreted correctly if HOME is set.
.SH FILES
An example of a file specifying predefined games:
.nf

.ne 7
# The following block specifies the distribution
# of cards for player1, 2, 3 and Skat(0).
# A 10  K  Q  J  9  8  7
  2  2  2  2  2  0  3  3  # Diamond
  2  2  2  2  2  3  3  3  # Heart
  1  1  1  1  1  3  3  3  # Spade
  1  1  1  1  1  0  3  3  # Club
.ne 7
# The following is not the same game !
# Player numbers rotate 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3
# (and depend on the start option).
  2  2  2  2  2  0  3  3
  2  2  2  2  2  3  3  3
  1  1  1  1  1  3  3  3
  1  1  1  1  1  0  3  3
.ne 4
repeat
# Repeat the above games forever.
# The following lines take effect only
# when you delete the 'repeat'.
.ne 9
random_seed 123456 0 2
# Specifies the random number which determines
# card distribution for all following games.
# The second number lets you skip that many
# games in the sequence.
# The third (optional) number defines
# who will start dealing cards (see \-start).
# An additional L or R following this number will
# rotate the cards left or right.
.ne 3
# The random_seed will be shown in game logs
# to allow easy replay. Just type:
# echo random_seed 123456 0 2 | xskat -game -
.fi
.SH NOTES
There are no official rules for the variations Ramsch, Kontra, Bock,
Spitze, Revolution, Klopfen and Schenken.
.PP
If executing
.BR "xskat player@otherhost:0" " on " yourhost
gives an error message you could try the command
.BR "xhost yourhost" " on " otherhost
to grant
.B yourhost
access to
.BR otherhost "'s "
display.
.PP
If you replay a game with your own cards, it doesn't matter
whether 'Forehand changes' is set to 'yes' or 'no'.
.PP
Some versions of telnet have a bug, that prevents them from
reading input from a pipe correctly.
See README.IRC for a fix or put this into your ~/.telnetrc:
